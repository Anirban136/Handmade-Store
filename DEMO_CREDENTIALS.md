# Demo Credentials for Testing

## Admin User
- **Email**: `admin@handycurv.com`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Role**: Admin

## Regular User
- **Email**: Any email (e.g., `user@example.com`)
- **Password**: `password123`
- **Role**: User

## Notes
- These are demo credentials for testing purposes only
- In a production environment, proper authentication and password hashing would be implemented
- The backend currently uses in-memory storage for simplicity
- All passwords are hardcoded for demo purposes

## Testing Steps
1. **Admin Login**: Use `admin@handycurv.com` with `admin123`
2. **User Registration**: Create a new account with any email and password `password123`
3. **User Login**: Use the registered email with `password123`
